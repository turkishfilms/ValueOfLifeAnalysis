---
## ( ) Refine the question:
-- ( ) Worth
--- ( ) How much will be traded to achieve goal?
---- ( ) Prevention
---- ( ) Intervention
---- ( ) Remediation
-- ( ) Human Life?
--- ( ) Age
--- ( ) Race
--- ( ) Financial Status
--- ( ) Disability
--- ( ) Gender/sexuality
--- ( ) Location
--- ( ) Viewpoints
--- ( ) Intelligence
-- ( ) Government
--- ( ) Which Government
---- ( ) Which Money?
----- ( ) Currency
----- ( ) Time/Inflation

## Approach:
-- Premise: An analysis of a governments actions will reveal how much they
   have spent to prevent death, save lives, and pay remediation. 
  -- Premise: How much a government spends to prevent death ,save human lives 
     and remediation is a function of how much they value human life. 
  -- Conclusion: An analysis of a governments actions will reveal how much they
value human life. 

-- Statement: Each evaluated action must have a cost, an estimated impact, a
   date and a location. 

  -- Process:
  --- For each action:
  ---- Find cost in dollars (adjust for inflation here?)
  ---- Find estimated impact in lives saved/deaths prevented/
  ---- find cost per person in remediation
  ---- calculate amount per life = ((dollars/lives)+remediation per person)/2
  ---- output amount per life
  --- calculate avg amount per life = Sum amounts/num of actions 
  ----- output avg amount per life (adjust for time or here?, and add location/demo data)
  -- Anchor: Evaluate how bad the human death problem is in key areas
  --- Traffic collisions
  --- Illness
  ---- Mental
  ---- Physical
  --- Violence
  --- Non Vehicular Accidents
  --- Natural Disasters 
  --- workplace
  --- SUD
  --- Substance OD
  --- Lifestyle
  --- Old Age
  --- Medical Errros
  --- pregnancy related
  --- environemt exposire/hunger

## Concerns:
  -- A government who sees this criteria could hypothetically spend lots of
     money on programs, and intentionally undervalue the impact to appear to
     care more about the lives than they do. 
  -- A government might be bad at estimating and get a better or worse score
     based on an unrelated skill.
  --- Solution: Measure actual lives saved/deaths prevented. 


## Questions:
-- Complicating Question: If a government spends money to save lives but it
   doesn't work, does that impact how much they value that problem?
  -- Complicating Question: If achieving any goal is a function of motivation
     to achieve and ability to achieve, then if a government is highly
     motivated to save human lives, would that also motiivate them to become
     more effective agents even if in short term it costs lives.
